## Keywords

- **Meta-heuristic Search-based Testing:** A form of white-box testing that generates test inputs by starting with a set of candidate inputs and then attempting to improve them based on some pre-defined fitness function. 

- **Constraint-based Testing:** Another form of white-box testing that basically generates test inputs by solving constraints produced by symbolic execution. May have problems when the input domain is excessively large (eg: non-linear functions or floating point arithmetic functions)
